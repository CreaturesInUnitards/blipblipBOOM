# mithril-sass-webpack-starter  

### Installation
```
$> npm install
```
### Usage
```
$> npm run start
```
...then open a browser and visit [http://localhost:8080]()  

Modifications made to html, sass and js files will automatically trigger a re-build and browser refresh.

### Deployment
You'll get a simple, production-ready build (located at './build') using
```
$> webpack -p
```

### Notes
Will work swimmingly with any folder structure, as long as modules are properly imported into ``` index.js ```.
